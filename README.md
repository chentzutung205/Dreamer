# Dreamer

Dreamer is a visual Model-Based Reinforcement algorithm, that learns a world model which captures latent dynamics from high-level pixel images and trains a control agent entirely in imagined rollouts from the learned world model.

This work is my attempt at reproducing Dreamerv1 & v2 papers in pytorch specifically for continuous control tasks in deepmind control suite.

#### Differences in implementation:

 1. Replay Buffer manages episodes instead of transitions, making sure that we don't mix episodes when sampling
 2. Although less flexible, Convolution models where layed out step by step for readibility
 3. This branch includes the integration of proprioception, allowing the agent to learn from internal state information in addition to visual input
 4. Proprioception support requires careful handling of shape inconsistencies across tasks. For example, some environments like `walker-walk` may report a proprio observation shape that is off by one. In such cases, you may need to manually adjust the shape in `dreamer.py` by modifying the line:
```
proprio_shape = train_env.observation_space['proprio'].shape[0] + 1
```

## Code Structure
Code structure is similar to original work by Danijar Hafner in Tensorflow

`dreamer.py`  - main function for training and evaluating dreamer agent

`utils.py`    - Logger, miscellaneous utility functions

`models.py`   - All the NNs for world model and actor

`replay_buffer.py` - Experience buffer for training world model

`env_wrapper.py`  - Gym wrapper for Dm_control suite

Runs can be configured from the config.json

## Installation

Run:
`conda env create -f environment.yml`

#### For training
`python dreamer.py --config config.json --env <env-name> --train`
#### For Evaluation
`python dreamer.py --config config.json --evaluate --env <env-name> --checkpoint_path '<your_ckpt_path>'`
